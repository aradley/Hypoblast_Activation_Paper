# Hypoblast Activation Paper
This repository contains the code used to re-create the single cell RNA sequencing analysis in our paper [Evidence implicating sequential commitment of the founder lineages in the human blastocyst by order of hypoblast gene activation](https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.201522).
The full commented workflow is available in the "Elena_Hypoblast_Workflow.py" file within this repository.
